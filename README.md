# Developer Kickstart Module 2: Flow Control, Loops, and Collections

This repository is part of the Developer Kickstart Module 2 curriculum at Cloud Code Academy. It is designed to help beginner Salesforce developers learn and practice flow control, loops, and collections in the Apex programming language.

## Goals of the Practice

Through this practice repository, you will gain foundational knowledge about:

- Flow control mechanisms in Apex, such as if-else statements and switch statements, to control the execution path based on conditions.
- Looping constructs in Apex, such as for loops, while loops, and do-while loops, to iterate over a set of statements or a collection of elements.
- Working with collections in Apex, including lists, sets, and maps, to store and manipulate data efficiently.

By mastering flow control, loops, and collections, you will enhance your ability to write flexible and powerful Apex code. These concepts are fundamental to building robust and efficient solutions in Salesforce.

5. Save and deploy your changes into Salesforce from your local machine. This can be done through the command pallet or right-clicking the file you want to deploy and using the option `SFDX: Deploy this source to org`

## Getting Started
1. Navigate to the folder force-app/main/default/ and deploy the metadata to your Salesforce org. Right-click on the folder and select `SFDX: Deploy Source to Org`.
2. Review the files provided including the test class to understand the challenges.
3. Update the code and deploy it to your Salesforce org.
4. Run the test class to validate your code. Use `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` to open the command palette and type 'SFDX: Run Apex Tests', then press Enter. You can also use `Run All Test` or `Run Test` on the test class.
5. Push your changes to your GitHub repository and submit the link to the assignment in the submission form in Slack.
